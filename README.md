# Expression Engine
Ross Byrne and Christy Madden's main 4th year project.

# Introduction
The expression engine is an expression builder. It allows users to build any expression with the use of the AND, OR, >, < and Equals operators. The data used in the expressions can be pulled from any data source provided they are implemented. Currently, the values that are evaluated are positive and negitive decimal and integer values.

# Instructions
The project is in an IntelliJ Idea project solution. The source code can be run by compiling and running Main.java in the package ie.gmit.sw. This will start the application.
